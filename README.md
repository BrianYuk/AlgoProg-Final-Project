# Doom in PyGame (Wolfenstein Style)
A remake of the 1993 Doom game in Wolfenstein style. Unlike the original game, this game only has 1 level so I highly suggest you don't expect much from this simple game of mine.

## How to Run
- Download all the files from the repository.
- Run the main.py file.

## Game Controls
W - Move forward<br>
A - Move left<br>
S - Move right<br>
D - Move backwards<br>

Left Mouse Button - Fire weapon (I cast GUN prepare to meet GOD)
Esc button - Quit the game
